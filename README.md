# Toddler Run

[Click here to see deployed game](http://github.com)

## Description

In this game your toddler is walking towards random objects in the flat. Some of these objects are safe to play with, but some of them he would destroy. Make sure, that he gets only the safe items, but hurry up, because he is getting faster and faster.

## MVP

- the game has a toddler moving from the left of the screen
- objects appear randomly from the right of the screen
- the objects have to be removed in the appearing order
- left arrow key removes the baby-safe object, right arrow key deletes the forbidden object
- every correct keypress increases the score by 1
- the speed increases when a certain score is reached
- when the baby reaches a forbidden object, or the wrong key was pressed, the game is over
- if a safe object is taken away from the baby, a life is lost

## Backlog

- add sound effects
- make the sizes responsive
